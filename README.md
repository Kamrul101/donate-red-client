# Donate Red

Blood donation is a vital, life-saving process, yet inefficiencies and delays often interrupt timely donations. This project aims to develop a web-based blood donation application using modern technologies to streamline blood donation. The application will enhance efficiency by providing real-time updates, filtering donors by blood type and location, and enabling direct communication between donors and seekers. This project includes features like:
- Develop an efficient, user-friendly web application to facilitate quicker and easier blood donations.
- Enable direct communication between blood donors and recipients to reduce emergency delays.
- Encourage and manage voluntary blood donations by simplifying the registration and donation process.
- Enforce the 90-day donation interval to ensure donors donate safely and responsibly.
- Reduce the time needed to find matching blood donors, especially in urgent situations, by incorporating blood type and area-based filtering.
- Use geolocation to help seekers find the nearest available donors.
- Notify donors instantly via web push notifications when a blood donation request is made, ensuring timely responses.
